## This project is designed to enhance your skills in React by building an application that interacts with real data via a RESTful API
Until now, we’ve only stored data in the browser using localStorage or relied on existing data from APIs like the Pokemon API or the Movie DB. However, in a real application, we will need to persist some data, which will ultimately live inside a database. For now, it should suffice to know that some APIs expose endpoints or methods to create, read, update, or delete data, collectively known as CRUD. These actions map to the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP request methods!


### APPLICATION for event management


ID	    Functional Requirement	            Description

FR001	Public GitHub Repository	        Keep all code in a single public repo; do not add instructors as collaborators.

FR002	Incremental Development with PRs	Merge every change into main exclusively via Pull Requests.

FR003	React + Vite Front-End	            Scaffold and run the app with Vite using React.

FR004	TailwindCSS Styling	                Style the UI with TailwindCSS (may augment with DaisyUI).

FR005	React Router Setup	                Configure routing with React Router, including protected routes.

FR006	State & Effects Management	        Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) to manage UI state and side-effects.

FR007	Run Local Events API	            Clone, install and run the provided Events API locally for development.

FR008	Home Page – Event List	            Fetch events (GET /api/events) and render them as cards sorted chronologically.

FR009	Event Card Navigation	            Clicking an event card navigates to /events/:id with React Router.

FR010	Event Details Page	                Fetch and display full event data by ID (GET /api/events/:id).

FR011	Sign-Up Page	                    Render registration form; send POST /api/users; on success redirect to Sign-In.

FR012	Sign-In Page	                    Render login form; send POST /api/auth/login; on success store API token and redirect to Home.

FR013	API Key Persistence	                Store/retrieve the user’s API token in localStorage.

FR014	Protected Route Layout	            Wrap routes that require authentication (e.g., Create Event) in a guard that redirects unauthenticated users to Sign-In.

FR015	Create Event Page	                Provide a form that sends POST /api/events with the token; block access and submission if no valid token.

FR016	Token Injection in Requests	        Automatically attach the stored token to request headers

FR017	Error Handling & Feedback	        Gracefully display API or network errors (e.g., auth failure, 404) to the user.

FR018	Responsive Design	                Ensure the UI remains usable across mobile and desktop break-points.

FR019	Static-Site Deployment	            Build the React app and deploy the static output to Render.
